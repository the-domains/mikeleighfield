## About Carol

Carol is a happy-go-lucky housewife who was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Carol and her husband Dale lived happily together in an upscale suburb where they could enjoy both nature and the conveniences of the city. In June of 1997 they had their only son Timothy. Their lives were going wonderfully until tragedy struck; in the spring of 2011, while Dale was working with the Wisconsin State Park Rangers, he was involved in a boating accident that took his life. Shocked and confused, Carol and her son began the grieving process. After 3 years of struggling to maintain the lives that they once had, Carol decided to start over. Having family living north of the border they decided to make the move to Toronto.

## About Tim

Tim, or Timmy as his mother calls him, is a moody teenager just fresh out of high school. He currently lives with his mother while he decides what he wants to do with his life. Tim is a normal teenager for the most part, but due to his fathers death he is severely jaded. He gets along well with his mother though he often finds that she can be rather clingy. Unfortunately for Tim, his mother is having a hard time adjusting to their new life in Toronto and she often has a way of attaching herself to his hip wherever he goes. While Tim finds this embarrassing and annoying, he knows that he relies on his mother just as much as she relies on him, he just doesn't need her knowing that.
